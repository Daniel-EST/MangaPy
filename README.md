# MangaPy
Python programm that downloads manga from Mangareader website (for now).

# Motivation
I love reading manga, but I can't stand doing it at computer. So, I always download chapters so I can read it later in my kindle while going to college. Then, I decided to make my own downloader, this way I can enjoy myself with mangas, and also learn a bit more about web scraping.  
<b>Disclaimer: When a manga is available at your country, please buy them. It makes a hell of an effort for the artist. Use this if knowledge and support those things you like most.</b>

Personal use, studying purposes.

# Future updates
-	Website selection option
-	Chapter range selection
-	User interface (maybe)

# Known Issues
After multiple downloads server stops due Mangareader bot control.
